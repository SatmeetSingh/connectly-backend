### Relationships Between Models

- **User ↔ Post**: One-to-many (a user can have many posts).

- **User ↔ Comment**: One-to-many (a user can have many comments).
- **User ↔ Like**: One-to-many (a user can like many posts).
- **User ↔ Follow**: Many-to-many (users can follow and be followed by multiple users).
- **Post ↔ Comment**: One-to-many (a post can have many comments).
- **Post ↔ Like**: One-to-many (a post can be liked by many users).
- **User ↔ Message**: One-to-many (a user can send/receive many messages).
- **User ↔ Notification**: One-to-many (a user can have many notifications).
- **User ↔ Group**: Many-to-many (users can join multiple groups).
- **User ↔ Event**: Many-to-many (users can RSVP to multiple events).

### Implementation Tips

- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure the integrity of your models (e.g., unique usernames, required fields).
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Use DTOs to manage the data being sent to and from the client, especially for APIs.
- **Database Migrations**: Use a migration tool like Entity Framework Core to manage changes to your database schema as your models evolve.
- **Indexing**: Consider indexing important fields (like `UserId` in the Post model) to improve query performance.

### Conclusion

The above models serve as a foundational structure for a social media application. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to expand or modify these models. It's important to also consider the user experience, performance, and scalability of your application as you design and implement these models.


### Extended Relationships

1. **User ↔ Notification** (Notification Recipients)
   - **Many-to-Many**: If notifications can be sent to multiple users (e.g., in the case of tagging or group messages), consider adding a join table like `NotificationRecipients` to track which users have received specific notifications.

2. **Post ↔ Tag** (For Hashtags or Post Categories)
   - **Many-to-Many**: If you want users to add hashtags or tags to categorize posts, you can create a `Tag` model and a join table like `PostTags`. This would allow each post to have multiple tags and each tag to be associated with multiple posts.

3. **User ↔ Role** (User Permissions)
   - **Many-to-Many**: In a production-grade application, implementing a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) system can help manage permissions. You could have a `Role` model (e.g., `Admin`, `Moderator`, `Standard User`) and a `UserRoles` join table to associate users with one or more roles.

4. **User ↔ Settings**
   - **One-to-One**: Each user could have unique settings (e.g., notification preferences, privacy settings). A `Settings` model can store these preferences and link to the `User` model.

5. **Post ↔ Location** (Geotagging)
   - **One-to-One**: If posts can have location tags, you could add a `Location` model linked to the `Post` model, storing coordinates or a place identifier.

6. **User ↔ Group** and **Group ↔ Post** (Group-Specific Posts)
   - **Many-to-Many** (User-Group): Track membership if users can join multiple groups.
   - **One-to-Many** (Group-Post): If posts can be group-specific, associate each post with a specific group.

7. **Event ↔ RSVP**
   - **Many-to-Many**: If users can RSVP to events, an `RSVP` model (or a `UserEvent` join table) allows tracking of users’ attendance status for events.

8. **Post ↔ Share** (Post Sharing)
   - **One-to-Many**: A `Share` model allows tracking which users have shared a particular post. This model could include a `SharedByUserId` and a `SharedPostId`.

9. **User ↔ BlockedUsers**
   - **Many-to-Many**: A `BlockedUsers` table lets users block other users, which could be a self-referencing table linking two `User` IDs.

### Example of Extended Relationships and Models

Adding some extended relationships could look like this:

- **UserRoles**: Links users to roles they have in the system.
- **PostTags**: Connects posts to hashtags or tags.
- **NotificationRecipients**: Tracks users associated with a particular notification.
- **UserEvent** (or **RSVP**): Connects users to events they’re attending.

### Extended Model List

If you add the above extended relationships, here’s a summary of all models:

1. **User**
2. **Post**
3. **Comment**
4. **Like**
5. **Follow**
6. **Message**
7. **Notification**
8. **Media**
9. **Report**
10. **Group**

13. **Role**
14. **Location**
15. **Tag**
16. **UserRoles** (for User ↔ Role)
17. **PostTags** (for Post ↔ Tag)
18. **NotificationRecipients** (for Notification ↔ User)
19. **RSVP** or **UserEvent** (for User ↔ Event)
20. **Share** (for Post sharing)

Each model and relationship adds new capabilities to the application, enabling you to create a more feature-complete social media app with production-grade functionality.
